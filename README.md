# algo_notes

## Purpose 
This repo contains lecture highlights, as well as concrete implementations of the algorithms which were discussed in class. It serves a purpose to help to review the materials faster.  

**Why a Github Repo?**  
  * Load faster than Google Docs.
  * Easier to manage, maintain and most importantly, to contribute.   
  * The table of contents' structure is clearer, finding a topic cannot be easier. 
  
**To Contribute:**
  * **Please must** create pull requests if you want to contribute, and the code must be tested and reviewed before merging into the master. 
  * The master branch should only contain bug-free code. 
  * _open to suggestions_
  
  **To Ask a Questions**: 
   * create a `issue` if you have any questions about the class material. So everybody can see and help to answer them. 
   

_More housekeeping rules to be added!_
